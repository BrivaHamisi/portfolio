# Portfolio Agent Guidelines

These guidelines are specific to this repository. Follow them closely; they reflect how this project is actually built, not an idealized stack.

## Foundational Context

This is a personal portfolio for Briva Hamisi (Software Engineer / Full-Stack Developer / Creative Designer), built with **Vue 3** on the **Vue CLI (webpack)** toolchain — not Vite. It is plain **JavaScript** (a `jsconfig.json` provides the `@/*` path alias for editor tooling only; there is no TypeScript compiler in the build). Styling is **Tailwind CSS** with hand-written utility classes. Routing is **Vue Router 4** — the homepage (`/`) is one long scrolling page, plus three "view more" pages under `/work/*` (Development, Graphic Design, Photography) for browsing a work category's full project list. There is no backend, API, database, or CMS — all content is static, hardcoded in components or small `src/data/*.js` files, and served from `public/`.

Before assuming a package's API, check `package.json` for the installed version rather than assuming the latest docs apply.

## Skills Activation

Activate `vue-best-practices` and `vue-router-best-practices` when touching components or routing. Activate `web-design-guidelines` when reviewing or changing layout, accessibility, or responsive behavior. There are no project-local skills under `**/skills/**` in this repo.

## Conventions

- Match the conventions of the file you're editing before applying a house style — this codebase mixes Options API (`src/App.vue`) and Composition API with `<script setup>` (most `src/components/sections/*.vue`). New or heavily-touched components should use `<script setup>` to match the majority pattern; don't rewrite working Options API components just to convert them.
- Use descriptive names for refs, computed values, and functions.
- Check `src/components/` and `src/components/sections/` for an existing component to reuse or extend before writing a new one.
- Content strings (bio, skills, experience) are currently hardcoded inline in components (e.g. `AboutMeSection.vue`) rather than centralized — follow that pattern unless asked to refactor it.

## Verification Scripts

- There is no test runner configured. Do not invent one-off verification scripts; instead run the dev server (`npm run serve`) and check the change in the browser, and run `npm run build` to confirm the production build succeeds.
