# Linear — Style Reference
> midnight precision instrument

**Theme:** dark

Linear's design system is a midnight command center built on near-black surfaces (#08090a) with paper-white type and one electric acid-lime accent (#e4f222) that functions as a functional flashlight — small, high-contrast, and used sparingly to signal action. The interface treats darkness as a substrate rather than a theme: text is crisp white at tight tracking (-0.022em), weights sit in a low 400–510 band rather than bold, and borders are hairline-thin (0.5px) to let geometry do the work that shadows usually would. Components feel precision-machined — 6px and 12px radii, compact 8–12px paddings, and almost no decorative ornament — letting the product UI (issue cards, kanban boards, AI agent panels) be the only visual texture in an otherwise quiet system.

## Tokens — Colors

| Name | Value | Token | Role |
|------|-------|-------|------|
| Void | `#08090a` | `--color-void` | Page canvas, full-bleed backgrounds — the default everything sits on |
| Carbon | `#0f1011` | `--color-carbon` | Card surfaces, nav bars — one step above canvas for contained content |
| Obsidian | `#161718` | `--color-obsidian` | Elevated surfaces, deeper card panels |
| Graphite | `#23252a` | `--color-graphite` | Subtle borders, dividers, ghost button outlines — low-contrast structural edges |
| Smoke | `#383b3f` | `--color-smoke` | Hairline borders at higher contrast than graphite — section separators |
| Ash | `#62666d` | `--color-ash` | Muted body text, inactive icons, secondary metadata |
| Fog | `#8a8f98` | `--color-fog` | Tertiary text, placeholder copy, icon fills |
| Mist | `#d0d6e0` | `--color-mist` | Secondary headings, button text on dark surfaces |
| Bone | `#e5e5e6` | `--color-bone` | Near-white surface fills, high-contrast button text |
| Paper | `#ffffff` | `--color-paper` | Primary headings, hero type, max-contrast emphasis text |
| Acid Lime | `#e4f222` | `--color-acid-lime` | Primary action buttons, active nav indicators — electric accent that breaks the monochrome system |
| Pulse Green | `#27a644` | `--color-pulse-green` | Green outline accent for tags, dividers, and focused UI edges. Use as a supporting accent, not as a status color |
| Coral Red | `#eb5757` | `--color-coral-red` | Red wash for highlight backgrounds, decorative bands, and soft emphasis behind content. Use as a supporting accent, not as a status color |
| Signal Teal | `#02b8cc` | `--color-signal-teal` | Decorative accent, informational icon fills |
| Iris Violet | `#6366f1` | `--color-iris-violet` | Tag/badge fills — soft chromatic punctuation on tags and labels |
| Lavender | `#8b5cf6` | `--color-lavender` | Secondary tag fills, category indicators |

### Berkeley Mono — Code-adjacent UI text — issue IDs (ENG-2703), keyboard shortcuts, monospaced metadata · `--font-berkeley-mono`
- **Substitute:** JetBrains Mono, IBM Plex Mono, or ui-monospace

> **Portfolio note:** this project uses Inter Variable only (loaded from Google Fonts, see `index.html`). Berkeley Mono is not used anywhere in this codebase — nothing here is code-adjacent UI (issue IDs, shortcuts). Don't introduce it without a real use case.
